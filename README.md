# CMPE277FinalApp
Our application intends to solve the problems of the common man trying to use the camera on his phone to simplify his daily life routines. Intelligent photo app is about how the app can detect real world object and categorize, classify, translate and also perform a variety of helpful operations on them without human intervention. Our app will be able to do something google photos does but it will also include a camera viewer along with a regular gallery. We also intend to implement some form of real time analysis camera viewfinder and some image enhancements like filters or ARcharacters. The addition of augmented reality is also a possibility we are taking into consideration.Annotations, footnotes, links, locations and comments can be added to the picture before the picture is added to the gallery.The user will also have the option to add previously taken pictures to be added into the app gallery for analysis. The project will be done in using Android Studio, since we feel it will have better integration with the GoogleCloud APIâ€™s that we are planning to use.
